# ASCII TABLE On Screen and To File - Proper IBM PC / DOS ASCII Table !!

My Delphi code to generate a proper IBM PC / DOS ASCII Table - with all of the extended chars filled in correctly, and the text meanings for most of the relevant chars at the start filled in.  e.g. BELL, CR, LF, etc.

## IBM PC / DOS ASCII Table:

Even now, long after my DOS days, I often need a full / proper IBM PC / DOS ASCII Table and hardly any on the internet seem to show the extended chars anymore - they mostly stop at 128 chars.

No need to faff around searching anymore, my code generates exactly what I need: to text file and I screen shot the output to file.

Maybe this is useful to someone else out there ???
